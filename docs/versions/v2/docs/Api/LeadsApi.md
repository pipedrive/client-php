Search leads

Searches all leads by title, notes and/or custom fields. This endpoint is a wrapper of <a href=\"https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/ItemSearch#searchItem\">/v1/itemSearch</a> with a narrower OAuth scope. Found leads can be filtered by the person ID and the organization ID.

$config = (new Pipedrive\versions\v2\Configuration())->setApiKey('api_token', 'YOUR_API_KEY');

$cursor = 'cursor_example'; // string | For pagination, the marker (an opaque string value) representing the first item on the next page

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->searchLeads($term, $fields, $exact_match, $person_id, $organization_id, $include_fields, $limit, $cursor);
